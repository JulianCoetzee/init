arp -a | awk '{print $2}' | tr -d '()'

or
arp -a | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | tr -d '()'

//arp -a - Address Resolution Protocal which is used to find the address of a network neighbour for a given IPv4 address. -a displays or deletes all of the current ARP entries

// awk - '{print $2}' prints out the second field - awk is a pattern-directed scanning and processing langues
// tr is used to translate, squeezem, and/or delete characters from standard input - In this context I think of tr as in trim but that is probabaly not correct
