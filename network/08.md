whois slash16.org | grep "Name Server"

// whois - is a utility that looks up records in the databases maintained by several Network Information Centers (NICs)

// I remember using the whois website to find out information about a website, when I found that I could use the utility in the terminal, if I just used grep tto look for the name server then one can see that AWS is the provider
