ifconfig en0 | grep "broadcast" | rev | cut -d ' ' -f 1 | rev

// en0 is ether net zero
// grep utility for selecting lines that match one or patterns
// rev utility reverses lines of a file
// use the cut utility to cut out portions of each line. Use the '-d flag' to specify the delimiter and '-f flag' to specify the field.

// My thinking here is I could have specified the -f 6 to print out but what if for some reason the broadcast address was always the last field. So why not reverse the line, the address becomes the first field the reverse it again. This does take up more resources though
