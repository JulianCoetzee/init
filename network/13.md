nslookup (ip gotten) | grep name

// this is not working but able to perform a reverse DNS lookup on this site

What I find funny is that blogs state that the nameserver which resolves the PTR records are the issue and I would need to contact whoever runs the nameserver to add a PTR entry for me to be able to run the reverse DNS
